# csgo-configs
A place to store my configs for "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"

If you wish to use either of these configs and you are on a Windows mahcine, put them in in following directory: <br />\[Your Steam path]\\steamappss\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\csgo\\cfg

For example, on my current machine the path looks like: <br />C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\csgo

If you are on a Mac you're on your own.

If you are on a Linux Machine you should be competent enough to find your config directory.

local_server - contains the commands I execute when I am messing around in an offline server.

autoexec - CS:GO executes this file on startup. I use it for storing my settings as it makes seting up a new machine very easy.
